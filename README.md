CitizenWatt-Base
================

This is the code running on the base (Raspberry Pi) for the CitizenWatt project. It receives incoming measures from the sensor and displays a web visualization to manage the measures.

## Installation

1. Write a Raspbian SD card.
2. Run the scripts in the `system` folder to install the necessary packages.
3. Run `make` to compile the `receive` program (needs extra librf24)
4. Use supervisord with the conf file in the `system` dir to handles the startup of the services.
4. (bis) Alternatively, launch `receive` (to actually receive the data), `process.py` (to receive the data from `receive` and store them in database) and the main script, `visu.py` which will serve the visualization.

## API documentation

This is a list of all the endpoints available in the API. You should authenticate yourself to use the API. For this purpose, use a POST request with `login` and `password` fields.

All the results are in a JSON dict, under the key `data`, for security purpose.

* /api/sensors
	* Returns all the available sensors with their associated measure types. If no sensors are found, returns `null`.

* /api/sensors/<id:int>
    * Returns all the infos for the specified sensor. If no matching sensor is found, returns `null`.

* /api/types
	* Returns all the available measure types. If no types are found, returns `null`.

* /api/time
    * Returns the current timestamp of the server.

* /api/<sensor:int>/get/watts/by_id/<nb:int>
    * Returns measure with id `<id1>` associated to sensor `<sensor>`, in watts.
    * If `<id1>` < 0, counts from the last measure, as in Python lists.
    * If no matching data is found, returns `null`.

* /api/<sensor:int>/get/<watt_euros:watts|kwatthours|euros>/by_id/<nb1:int>/<nb2:int>
    * Returns measures between ids `<id1>` and `<id2>` from sensor `<sensor>` in watts or euros.
    * If `<id1>` and `<id2>` are negative, counts from the end of the measures.
    * Depending on `<watt_euros>`:
        * If it is `watts`, returns the list of measures.
        * If it is `kwatthours`, returns the total energy for all the measures (dict).
        * If it is `euros`, returns the cost of all the measures (dict).
    * Returns measure in ASC order of timestamp.
    * Returns `null` if no measures were found.

* /api/<sensor:int>/get/<[watt_euros:watts|kwatthours|euros>/by_id/<id1:int>/<id2:int>/<step:int>
    * Returns all the measures of sensor `sensor` between ids `<id1>` and `<id2>`, grouped by `<step>`, as a list of the number of steps element.`<step>` should be positive.
    * Each item is `null` if no matching measures are found.
    * Depending on `<watt_euros>`:
        * If it is `watts`, returns the mean power for each group.
        * If it is `kwatthours`, returns the total energy for each group.
        * If it is `euros`, returns the cost of each group.
    * Returns measure in ASC order of timestamp.
    * Returns `null` if no measures were found.

* /api/<sensor:int>/get/<watt_euros:watts|kwatthours|euros>/by_time/<time1:float>/<time2:float>
    * Returns measures between timestamps `<time1>` and `<time2>` from sensor `<sensor>` in watts or euros.
    * Depending on `<watt_euros>`:
        * If it is `watts`, returns the list of measures.
        * If it is `kwatthours`, returns the total energy for all the measures (dict).
        * If it is `euros`, returns the cost of all the measures (dict).
    * Returns measure in ASC order of timestamp.
    * Returns `null` if no matching measures are found.

* /api/<sensor:int>/get/<watt_euros:watts|kwatthours|euros>/by_time/<time1:float>/<time2:float>/<step:float>"
    * Returns all the measures of sensor `sensor` between timestamps `time1` and `time2`, grouped by step, as a list of the number of steps element.
    * Each item is `null` if no matching measures are found.
    * Depending on `<watt_euros>`:
        * If it is `watts`, returns the mean power for each group.
        * If it is `kwatthours`, returns the total energy for each group.
        * If it is `euros`, returns the cost of each group.
    * Returns measure in ASC order of timestamp.

* /api/energy_providers
    * Returns all the available energy providers or `null` if none found.

* /api/energy_providers/<id:current|int>
    * Returns the current energy provider (if `id == "current"`), or the energy provider with the specified id.

* /api/<energy_provider:current|int>/watt_to_euros/<tariff:night|day>/<consumption:float>
    * Returns the cost in euros associated with a certain consumption, in kWh.
    * One should specify the tariff (night or day, day if no such distinction is to be done) and the id of the energy_provider.
    * Returns `null` if no valid result to return.
